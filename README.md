# test-prime
Finding prime numbers


Assignment: "Nested Loop and Leaf Procedures"

1: Write an assembly-language code to test if a positive integer number n is a prime number.
Implement your code using a leaf procedure named testPrime(n), which will return 1 if n is prime and return 0 otherwise.

Also, follow the convention of saving the values of different registers, e.g., $t0, $s0, in the stack memory as usually done by the caller and callee of a procedure.

2: Using the testPrime(n) procedure, write an assembly-language code that prints the first 100 prime numbers. Apply the same convention of saving register values during the procedure call, as mentioned above.
